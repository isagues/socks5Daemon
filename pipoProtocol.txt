                        Socks5d Proxy Administration Protocol

Acknowledgments

    This memo describes a protocol that was designed for the University Subject
    'Protocolos de Comunicaci√≥n'.  The key contributors are:
    Tobias Brandy, Ignacio Sagues and Faustino Pannunzio.        

1. Introduction

    The goal of this protocol is to provide a mechanism for interacting with a running
    Socks5d Server. The Client might ask for information held by the
    Server such as the list of users or the total historic connections of the Server.
    The Client will also be able to modify information and properties of the server
    such as adding or deleting a user, setting up password sniffing or changing the I/O buffer sizes.
    In order to maintain security, authentication with the server upon connection is required.
    Once authenticated, the connection follows a Request/Response structure, where the
    Client makes the requests, and the Server processes and responds. Pipelining is supported.

2. Connection and Authentication

   2.1. Connection
        When a SCTP-based Client wishes to establish a connection to the socks5d Server 
        it must open a SCTP connection to the appropriate port on the server system. 
        The Socks5d Administration service is conventionally located on port 8080.
        
   2.2. Authentication
        Once the connection with the socks5d server has started, the client produces an
        authentication request:

                +-----+------+----------+------+----------+
                | VER | ULEN |  UNAME   | PLEN |  PASSWD  |
                +-----+------+----------+------+----------+
                |  1  |  1   | 1 to 255 |  1   | 1 to 255 |
                +-----+------+----------+------+----------+
        
        The Ver field contains the current version of the negotiation, which is X'01'. 
        The ULEN field contains a 1 byte unsigned integer which represents the length of the UNAME field that follows.
        The UNAME field contains the username as known to the Server. Only the ASCII charset is supported.
        The PLEN field contains a 1 byte unsigned integer which represents the length of the PASSWD field that follows. 
        The PASSWD field contains the password associated with the given UNAME. Only the ASCII charset is supported.

        The server verifies the supplied UNAME and PASSWD, and if corresponds to a user
        with administrator privileges it sends the following response: 
                
                                +-----+--------+
                                | VER | STATUS |
                                +-----+--------+
                                |  1  |   1    |
                                +-----+--------+

        A STATUS field of X'00' indicates the authentication was successful.
        A STATUS field of X'01' indicates the authentication failed.
        A STATUS field of X'02' indicates invalid version
        
        If the server returns a failure status, it MUST close the connection.

        If the server returns a success status, then the session is fully established.

3. General Request and Response Structure

    Once the client is authenticated, the following messages will follow a Request/Response structure.
    The client sends a Request and the server answers with a corresponding Response message.

    All messages from now on include the fields TYPE and CMD (Command) which are 1 byte long. 
    In the Request, this fields are the ones which indicate the server the action it must perform,
    the other fields are just arguments of that action.
    In the Response, the TYPE and CMD fields MUST match the ones from their corresponding Request,
    unless an error ocurred.

    The values currently defined as TYPE are:

        o   X'00'   Query
        o   X'01'   Modification
        o   X'FF'   Invalid TYPE

    Each TYPE of Request has a set of Commands associated with it.
    
    Commands associated with the Query TYPE are meant as data retrieval Commands,
    meaning they won't affect the state of the Server. On the other hand, the primary function of Commands
    associated with the Modification TYPE is to modify the Server configuration.

    The associated Commands (CMD) for the Query TYPE are:

        o   X'00'   List Users
        o   X'01'   Get Total Historic Connections
        o   X'02'   Get Current Connections
        o   X'03'   Get Max. Concurrent Connections
        o   X'04'   Get Total Bytes Sent
        o   X'05'   Get Total Bytes Received
        o   X'06'   Get Number of Users Connected
        o   X'07'   Get Total User Count     
        o   X'08'   Get I/O Buffer Sizes
        o   X'09'   Get Selector Timeout 
        o   X'0A'   Get Connection Timeout
        o   X'0B'   Get User Total Current Connections
        o   X'FE'   Query Error
        o   X'FF'   Invalid CMD


    The associated Commands (CMD) for the Modification TYPE are:

        o   X'00'   Add User
        o   X'01'   Remove User
        o   X'02'   Enable/Disable Password Spoofing
        o   X'03'   Enable/Disable Connection Clean-up Routine
        o   X'04'   Set I/O Buffer Sizes
        o   X'05'   Set Selector Timeout
        o   X'06'   Set Connection Timeout
        o   X'FF'   Invalid CMD

    If an invalid TYPE or CMD is sent to the Server, the Server MUST respond with the message:

        +------+-----+
        | TYPE | CMD |
        +------+-----+
        |   1  |  1  |
        +------+-----+
    
    If and invalid TYPE is sent in the Request, both TYPE and CMD will have the value X'FF' in the Response.
    If a valid TYPE and an invalid CMD (for that TYPE) is sent in the Request, the Response will have the TYPE field
    set with the same value as in the Request, and the CMD field set with the value X'FF'.

    The values X'FF' and X'FE' for TYPE and CMD SHOULD never be included in a Request message, as they are
    reserved to notify errors.

4. Modification Commands

    4.1. Requests

        4.1.1. Add User

                The use of this Command will create a new user in the Server. 
                The new user's username, password and privilege level must be included.
                Only one user per username is allowed.
                
                For using it the Client provides the following Request:
                
                +------+-----+------+----------+------+----------+--------------+

                +------+-----+------+----------+------+----------+--------------+

                The ULEN, UNAME, PLEN, PASSWD fields are defined the same way they were in 2.2.

                The values currently defined as PRIVILEGE are:

                    o   X'00'   Regular User
                    o   X'01'   Administrator

                A privilege value of X'00' will indicate that the new user will only be able to connect
                with the proxy server whereas an X'01' value will indicate that the 
                user is an administrator who will be able to connect with the server via
                this protocol, allowing them to use all it's provided functionalities.
        
        4.1.2. Remove User

                The use of this Command will remove a user in the Server which has the provided username
                associated, if it exists.
                
                For using it the Client provides the following Request:

                +------+-----+--------+----------+

                The ULEN, UNAME fields are defined the same way they were in 2.2.
                
        4.1.3. Enable/Disable Password Spoofing
        
                The use of this command will enable/disable for all connections the spoofing of the
                passwords sent through the Server once a connection has been established.

                For using it the Client provides the following Request:

                +------+-----+--------+

            +------+-----+----------+--------+-----------+---------------+----------+--------+-----------+-------------+

            Where USRLEN is a 1 byte long unsigned integer that describes the amount of users listed.

            The message contains that amount of fields ULEN, UNAME and PRIVILEGE, which are the same as
            those defined in 2.2 and 4.1.1.
